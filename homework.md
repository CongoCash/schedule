## Monday, August 14
1. Complete (to be turned in!) the Fundamentals Assessment that you received in class.
2. Finish the Site Recreation Training, if you haven't already.
3. Go back to the HTML/CSS review from this morning and review any of the answers that were surprising or that you didn't understand. Try incorporating those ideas/commands within the Site Recreation.
