## Monday, August 14
1. Complete (to be turned in!) the Fundamentals Assessment that you received in class.
2. Finish the [Site Recreation Training](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/site-recreation), if you haven't already.
3. Go back to the [HTML/CSS review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KyKeZrdqM40FXD-dSgky5FhtaX8ckyakOIJBCkaSZWg/edit) from this morning and review any of the answers that were surprising or that you didn't understand. Try incorporating those ideas/commands within the Site Recreation.
