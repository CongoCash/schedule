## Course Information

### Class Hours
Class starts at 9am; being more than 15 minutes late counts as a tardy, as does leaving class more than 15 minutes early. (We will often have a soft end to the day, where you're working on a lab at the end of the day and as homework, and we won't care about you leaving early; but that shouldn't be assumed, especially early in the course.)

### Homework
We will post the lecture materials each night for the next day. It's a good idea to skim or read those materials, as they'll prepare you for the lecture we'll do in class. However, you should NOT start working on labs or writing code based on the next day's materials; if you do, you'll lose the opportunity to work on that lab with your classmates the next day.

When we have other homework that we want you to turn in, it will be posted on the course schedule (the README.md file in this repo). It is your responsibility to check the schedule and complete the homework listed there.

### Feedback
We will provide significant written feedback on your major projects, and a mixture of written and verbal feedback on homework assignments and weekend labs. Anything that is on GitHub is "fair game" for us to look at and give you feedback on, or for a code review.

### 1:1s
You will have mandatory 1:1s with both instructors in the first two weeks of the course. After that, you can sign up for more 1:1s at will by entering your name in the Google sheet.
